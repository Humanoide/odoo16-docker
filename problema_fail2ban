cd /tmp/
# 1) download deb package and signature:
wget -O fail2ban.deb https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/releases/download/1.1.0/fail2ban_1.1.0-1.upstream1_all.deb
wget -O fail2ban.deb.asc https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/releases/download/1.1.0/fail2ban_1.1.0-1.upstream1_all.deb.asc


# 5a) install package using dpkg (standalone package, don't regard dependencies):
sudo dpkg -i fail2ban.deb
# if the package introduces some "broken" dependencies (I don't think so in case of fail2ban which has few dependencies),
# to fix the unmet dependency issue, run this:
sudo apt -f install


# Start the service:
sudo systemctl start fail2ban

# And check the status if the service is running well:
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
