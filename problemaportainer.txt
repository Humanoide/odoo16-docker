You can fix it without downgrading Docker or Portainer. You can add the variable DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24 to the docker service config ( this fixes the issue for Traefik aswell if you are using this, since traefik uses the version 1.24 )

systemctl edit docker.service
Add this part above the line ### Lines below this comment will be discarded:
[Service]
Environment=DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24
Save the file and exit
systemctl restart docker
Edit: We are using Version: 2.27.3 LTS Community Edition and did not encounter any issues whatsoever after doing that.

Edit 2: If you are using the Business Edition it seems that there still is an issue with you not being able to see the docker-compose.yml files for your stacks. The CE edition does not have this issue.
